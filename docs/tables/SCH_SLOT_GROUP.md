| 4 | `ACTIVE_STATUS_PRSNL_ID` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | The person who caused the active_status_cd to be set or change. |
| 5 | `BEG_EFFECTIVE_DT_TM` | DATETIME |  |  | The date and time for which this table row becomes effective. Normally, this will be the date and time the row is added, but could be a past or future date and time. |

| 10 | `LOGICAL_DOMAIN_ID` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL | FK→ | The unique identifier for a logical domain. This identifier allows the data to be grouped by logical domain. For example, If you assign clients a logical_domain_id this would allow you to store data for multiple clients on this table. |
| 11 | `MNEMONIC` | VARCHAR(100) | NOT NULL |  | A 100-character string used for identification and selection. |
| 12 | `MNEMONIC_KEY` | VARCHAR(100) | NOT NULL |  | The MNEMONIC in uppercase with the non-alphanumeric characters removed. |
