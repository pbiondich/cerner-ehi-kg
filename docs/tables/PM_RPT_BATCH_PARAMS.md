| # | Column | Type | Null? | Flags | Definition |
|--:|--------|------|:-----:|-------|------------|

| 2 | `ACTIVE_STATUS_CD` | DOUBLE |  |  | Indicates the status of the row itself (not the data in the row) such as active, inactive, combined away, pending purge, etc. |
| 3 | `ACTIVE_STATUS_DT_TM` | DATETIME |  |  | The date and time that the active_status_cd was set. |
| 4 | `ACTIVE_STATUS_PRSNL_ID` | DOUBLE |  |  | The person who caused the active_status_cd to be set or change. |
| 5 | `BATCH_ID` | DOUBLE |  | FK→ | Foreign Key to the PM_RPT_BATCH table used in Person Management Reporting |
| 6 | `BATCH_PARAMS_ID` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | Primary Key attribute |
| 7 | `BEG_EFFECTIVE_DT_TM` | DATETIME |  |  | The date and time for which this table row becomes effective. Normally, this will be the date and time the row is added, but could be a past or future date and time. |
| 8 | `COPIES` | DOUBLE |  |  | Number of copies to print for a particular report in a specific batch |
| 9 | `DATA_STATUS_CD` | DOUBLE |  |  | Data status indicates a level of authenticity of the row data. Typically this will either be AUTHENTICATED or UNAUTHENTICATED. |

| 14 | `REPORT_ID` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL | FK→ | Foreign Key attribute to the PM_RPT_REPORT table used in Person Management Reporting |

| 16 | `UPDT_CNT` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | Set to 0 on insert. Incremented by 1 on update. Used to recognize update conflict where data in a row updated by one application is at risk of being lost by a second application attempting to update the row. |
| 17 | `UPDT_DT_TM` | DATETIME | NOT NULL |  | The date and time the row was last inserted or updated. |
| 18 | `UPDT_ID` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | The person_id of the person from the personnel table (prsnl) that caused the last insert or update of the row in the table. |
