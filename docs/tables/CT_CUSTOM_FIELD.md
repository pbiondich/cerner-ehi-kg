## Columns

| # | Column | Type | Null? | Flags | Definition |
|--:|--------|------|:-----:|-------|------------|
| 1 | `ACTIVE_IND` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | The table row is active or inactive. A row is generally active unless it is in an inactive state such as logically deleted, combined away, pending purge, etc. |
| 2 | `CODE_SET` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | This field contains the code set number that will be used for the field. |
| 3 | `CT_CUSTOM_FIELD_ID` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL | PK | Primary key |
| 4 | `FIELD_KEY` | VARCHAR(30) | NOT NULL |  | Contains the Field Key data. Uniquely identifies an active row of data. |
| 5 | `FIELD_LABEL` | VARCHAR(255) |  |  | This field contains text that will be used for the label. |
| 6 | `FIELD_TYPE_CD` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | This field contains the code that defines the field type. |
| 7 | `LOGICAL_DOMAIN_ID` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL | FK→ | The unique identifier for a logical domain. This identifier allows the data to be grouped by logical domain. For example, If you assign clients a logical_domain_id this would allow you to store data for multiple clients on this table. |
| 8 | `UPDT_APPLCTX` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | The application context number from the record info block. The UPDT family of columns are typically used for housekeeping and external system process and should never be depended on for solution specific logic. |
| 9 | `UPDT_CNT` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | Set to 0 on insert. Incremented by 1 on update. Used to recognize update conflict where data in a row updated by one application is at risk of being lost by a second application attempting to update the row. The UPDT family of columns are typically used for housekeeping and external system process and should never be depended on for solution specific logic. |
| 10 | `UPDT_DT_TM` | DATETIME | NOT NULL |  | The date and time the row was last inserted or updated. The UPDT family of columns are typically used for housekeeping and external system process and should never be depended on for solution specific logic. |
| 11 | `UPDT_ID` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | The person_id of the person from the personnel table (prsnl) that caused the last insert or update of the row in the table. The UPDT family of columns are typically used for housekeeping and external system process and should never be depended on for solution specific logic. |
