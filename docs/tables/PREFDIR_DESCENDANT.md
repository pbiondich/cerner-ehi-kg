# PREFDIR_DESCENDANT

> The purpose of the descendant table is to support the subtree search feature of the preference service. For each entry with a unique id this table contains the unique identifiers of the descendant entries. For every entry in the directory, a row exists in this table for each of its ancestors including itself. The size of the table depends on the depth of each entry.

**Description:** Preference directory descendants.  
**Table type:** REFERENCE  
**Primary key:** _(not published — see note)_  
**Columns:** 7
