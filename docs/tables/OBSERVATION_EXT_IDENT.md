## Columns

| # | Column | Type | Null? | Flags | Definition |
|--:|--------|------|:-----:|-------|------------|
| 1 | `EVENT_ID` | DOUBLE |  |  | The event identifier which identifies Events in the CLINICAL_EVENT Table |
| 2 | `LOGICAL_DOMAIN_ID` | DOUBLE |  | FK→ | The unique identifier for a logical domain. This identifier allows the data to be grouped by logical domain. For example, If you assign clients a logical_domain_id this would allow you to store data for multiple clients on this table. |
| 3 | `OBSERVATION_EXT_IDENT_ID` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | The Primary Key for this table |
| 4 | `SYSTEM_URI` | VARCHAR(80) |  |  | The system URI . Example system_uri: https://fhir.cerner.com/ceuuid |
| 5 | `UPDT_APPLCTX` | DOUBLE |  |  | The application context number from the record info block. The UPDT family of columns are typically used for housekeeping and external system process and should never be depended on for solution specific logic. |
| 6 | `UPDT_CNT` | DOUBLE |  |  | Set to 0 on insert. Incremented by 1 on update. Used to recognize update conflict where data in a row updated by one application is at risk of being lost by a second application attempting to update the row. The UPDT family of columns are typically used for housekeeping and external system process and should never be depended on for solution specific logic. |
| 7 | `UPDT_DT_TM` | DATETIME |  |  | The date and time the row was last inserted or updated. The UPDT family of columns are typically used for housekeeping and external system process and should never be depended on for solution specific logic. |
| 8 | `UPDT_ID` | DOUBLE |  |  | The person_id of the person from the personnel table (prsnl) that caused the last insert or update of the row in the table. The UPDT family of columns are typically used for housekeeping and external system process and should never be depended on for solution specific logic. |
| 9 | `UPDT_TASK` | DOUBLE |  |  | The registered (assigned) task number for the process that inserted or updated the row. The UPDT family of columns are typically used for housekeeping and external system process and should never be depended on for solution specific logic. |
| 10 | `VALUE_TXT` | VARCHAR(200) |  |  | The value string. The value_txt maps back to a ceuuid as described by the system_uri. Example value_txt: CE87caf4b7-9397-4667-9897-702218017c9e-231079242-2024093014022000 |
