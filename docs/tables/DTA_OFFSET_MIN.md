| 3 | `DTA_OFFSET_MIN_ID` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | Unique, generated number that identifies a row on the DTA_OFFSET_MIN table. |
| 4 | `END_EFFECTIVE_DT_TM` | DATETIME | NOT NULL |  | The date/time after which the row is no longer valid as active current data. This may be valued with the date that the row became inactive. |
