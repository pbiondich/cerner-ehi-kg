| 2 | `ACTIVE_STATUS_CD` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | Indicates the status of the row itself (not the data in the row) such as active, inactive, combined away, pending purge, etc. |
| 3 | `ACTIVE_STATUS_DT_TM` | DATETIME |  |  | The date and time that the active_status_cd was set. |
| 4 | `ACTIVE_STATUS_PRSNL_ID` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | The person who caused the active_status_cd to be set or change. |
| 5 | `ALIAS_ENTITY_ALIAS_TYPE_CD` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | Alias entity type code identifies the type of the alias for the given entity_name. (MRN, SSN, FIN, ESIORGALIAS, etc.) |
| 6 | `ALIAS_ENTITY_NAME` | VARCHAR(32) | NOT NULL |  | The upper case name of the table to which this alias relation row is related. |
| 7 | `ALIAS_POOL_CD` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL | FK→ | Alias pool code identifies a unique set or list of identifiers (I.e., numbers). The alias pool code also determines the accept/display format for the unique set of identifiers. |

| 9 | `BEG_EFFECTIVE_DT_TM` | DATETIME |  |  | The date and time for which this table row becomes effective. Normally, this will be the date and time the row is added, but could be a past or future date and time. |

| 12 | `UPDT_APPLCTX` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | The application context number from the record info block. |
| 13 | `UPDT_CNT` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | Set to 0 on insert. Incremented by 1 on update. Used to recognize update conflict where data in a row updated by one application is at risk of being lost by a second application attempting to update the row. |
