## Columns

| # | Column | Type | Null? | Flags | Definition |
|--:|--------|------|:-----:|-------|------------|
| 1 | `CATALOG_CD` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL | FK→ | This field contains the code value assigned to the procedure as defined in the DCPtools.exe application. Ordered procedure code values are stored on code set 200 Order Catalog. |
| 2 | `ORDER_ID` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL | FK→ | This field contains the unique value assigned to each orderable procedure associated with an order. For example: if there are two procedures on the same accession number, then each procedure will have a unique order id. |
| 3 | `PATHOGEN_CD` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL | FK→ | This field identifies the code value of the organism associated with the orderable procedure. Organisms are defined on code set 1021. |
| 4 | `UPDT_APPLCTX` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | The application context number from the record info block. |
| 5 | `UPDT_CNT` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | Set to 0 on insert. Incremented by 1 on update. Used to recognize update conflict where data in a row updated by one application is at risk of being lost by a second application attempting to update the row. |
| 6 | `UPDT_DT_TM` | DATETIME | NOT NULL |  | The date and time the row was last inserted or updated. |
| 7 | `UPDT_ID` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | The person_id of the person from the personnel table (prsnl) that caused the last insert or update of the row in the table. |
| 8 | `UPDT_TASK` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | The registered (assigned) task number for the process that inserted or updated the row. |
