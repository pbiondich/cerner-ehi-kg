| 8 | `BEG_EFFECTIVE_DT_TM` | DATETIME |  |  | The date and time for which this table row becomes effective. Normally, this will be the date and time the row is added, but could be a past or future date and time. |

| 17 | `UPDT_CNT` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | Set to 0 on insert. Incremented by 1 on update. Used to recognize update conflict where data in a row updated by one application is at risk of being lost by a second application attempting to update the row.

| 18 | `UPDT_DT_TM` | DATETIME | NOT NULL |  | The date and time the row was last inserted or updated. The UPDT family of columns are typically used for housekeeping and external system process and should never be depended on for solution specific logic. |
