## Columns

| # | Column | Type | Null? | Flags | Definition |
|--:|--------|------|:-----:|-------|------------|
| 1 | `ACTIVE_IND` | DOUBLE |  |  | The table row is active or inactive. A row is generally active unless it is in an inactive state such as logically deleted, combined away, pending purge, etc. |
| 2 | `ACTIVE_STATUS_CD` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | Indicates the status of the row itself (not the data in the row) such as active, inactive, combined away, pending purge, etc. |
| 3 | `ACTIVE_STATUS_DT_TM` | DATETIME |  |  | The date and time that the active_status_cd was set. |
| 4 | `ACTIVE_STATUS_PRSNL_ID` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | The person who caused the active_status_cd to be set or change. |
| 5 | `BEG_EFFECTIVE_DT_TM` | DATETIME |  |  | The date and time for which this table row becomes effective. Normally, this will be the date and time the row is added, but could be a past or future date and time. |
| 6 | `CANDIDATE_ID` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | A sequence-generated number to uniquely identify the specific row in the database. |
| 7 | `END_EFFECTIVE_DT_TM` | DATETIME |  |  | The date/time after which the row is no longer valid as active current data. This may be valued with the date that the row became inactive. |
| 8 | `FLEX_SEQ_NBR` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | The sequence of the flex token within the flex string. |
| 9 | `NULL_DT_TM` | DATETIME | NOT NULL |  | contains 31-DEC-2100 00:00:00.00. This field is used to maintain foreign keys to tables that contain a VERSION_DT_TM in the primary key. |
| 10 | `PARENT2_ID` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | The unique identifier of the parent object. |
| 11 | `PARENT2_TABLE` | VARCHAR(32) | NOT NULL |  | The parent table corresponding to the PARENT2_ID |
| 12 | `PARENT_ID` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | The unique identifier of the parent object. |
| 13 | `PARENT_TABLE` | VARCHAR(32) | NOT NULL |  | The parent table corresponding to the PARENT_ID |

| 18 | `UPDT_DT_TM` | DATETIME | NOT NULL |  | The date and time the row was last inserted or updated. |
| 19 | `UPDT_ID` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | The person_id of the person from the personnel table (prsnl) that caused the last insert or update of the row in the table. |
