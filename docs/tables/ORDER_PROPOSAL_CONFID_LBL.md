| 2 | `ACTIVE_IND` | DOUBLE |  |  | The table row is active or inactive. A row is generally active unless it is in an inactive state such as logically deleted, combined away, pending purge, etc. |
| 3 | `BEG_EFFECTIVE_DT_TM` | DATETIME |  |  | The date and time for which this table row becomes effective. Normally, this will be the date and time the row is added, but could be a past or future date and time. |
| 4 | `CONFID_LBL_CD` | DOUBLE |  |  | The code value indicating why the tagged data is considered confidential. Values should be taken from the SENSITIVITY_REASON Code Set (4702082) and ORDERS_SENSITIVITY_REASON (4740922). This column will support other code sets in the future. |
| 5 | `CREATED_BY_PRSNL_ID` | DOUBLE |  | FK→ | The ID of the person who created this confidentiality label. |

Used to recognize update conflict where data in a row updated by one application is at risk of being lost by a second application attempting to update the row. The UPDT family of columns are typically used for housekeeping and external system process and should never be depended on for solution specific logic. |
| 11 | `UPDT_DT_TM` | DATETIME |  |  | The date and time the row was last inserted or updated. The UPDT family of columns are typically used for housekeeping and external system process and should never be depended on for solution specific logic. |
