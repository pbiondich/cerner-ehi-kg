| # | Column | Type | Null? | Flags | Definition |
|--:|--------|------|:-----:|-------|------------|
| 1 | `ACTIVE_IND` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | The table row is active or inactive. A row is generally active unless it is in an inactive state such as logically deleted, combined away, pending purge, etc. |
| 2 | `BEG_EFFECTIVE_DT_TM` | DATETIME |  |  | The date and time for which this table row becomes effective. Normally, this will be the date and time the row is added, but could be a past or future date and time. |
| 3 | `CODING_AUDIT_TRIGGER_ID` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL | PK | This is the unique identifier for a procedure history row. It is an internal, system-assigned number. |
| 4 | `CONTRIBUTOR_SYSTEM_CD` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | Contributor system identifies the source feed of data from which a row was populated. This is mainly used to determine how to update a set of data that may have originated from more than one source feed. |
| 5 | `END_EFFECTIVE_DT_TM` | DATETIME |  |  | The date/time after which the row is no longer valid as active current data. This may be valued with the date that the row became inactive. |
| 6 | `EXTERNAL_AUDIT_MSG` | VARCHAR(4000) | NOT NULL |  | The external audit message for the coding audit trigger. The reason for the audit. |
| 7 | `EXTERNAL_AUDIT_MSG_IDENT` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | The external audit message reference for the coding audit trigger. |
| 8 | `EXTERNAL_EDIT_IDENT` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | The external edit reference for the coding audit trigger. |
| 9 | `EXTERNAL_EDIT_IDENT_TXT` | VARCHAR(100) | NOT NULL |  | The external edit reference for the coding audit trigger. |
| 10 | `UPDT_APPLCTX` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | The application context number from the record info block. The UPDT family of columns are typically used for housekeeping and external system process and should never be depended on for solution specific logic. |
| 11 | `UPDT_CNT` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | Set to 0 on insert. Incremented by 1 on update. Used to recognize update conflict where data in a row updated by one application is at risk of being lost by a second application attempting to update the row. The UPDT family of columns are typically used for housekeeping and external system process and should never be depended on for solution specific logic. |
| 12 | `UPDT_DT_TM` | DATETIME | NOT NULL |  | The date and time the row was last inserted or updated. The UPDT family of columns are typically used for housekeeping and external system process and should never be depended on for solution specific logic. |
| 13 | `UPDT_ID` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | The person_id of the person from the personnel table (prsnl) that caused the last insert or update of the row in the table. The UPDT family of columns are typically used for housekeeping and external system process and should never be depended on for solution specific logic. |
| 14 | `UPDT_TASK` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | The registered (assigned) task number for the process that inserted or updated the row. The UPDT family of columns are typically used for housekeeping and external system process and should never be depended on for solution specific logic. |
