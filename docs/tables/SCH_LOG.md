| 5 | `APPLICATION_NUMBER` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | Application Number of the application generating the error. |
| 6 | `BEG_EFFECTIVE_DT_TM` | DATETIME |  |  | The date and time for which this table row becomes effective. Normally, this will be the date and time the row is added, but could be a past or future date and time. |

| 10 | `MNEMONIC` | VARCHAR(100) |  |  | A 100-character string used for identification and selection. |
| 11 | `NULL_DT_TM` | DATETIME | NOT NULL |  | contains 31-DEC-2100 00:00:00.00. This field is used to maintain foreign keys to tables that contain a VERSION_DT_TM in the primary key. |
| 12 | `PRSNL_ID` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL | FK→ | The PERSON_ID of the person from the personnel table (PRSNL) that performed the action. |
| 13 | `REQUEST_NUMBER` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | The request number of the request that failed. |

| 19 | `UPDT_ID` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | The person_id of the person from the personnel table (prsnl) that caused the last insert or update of the row in the table. |
