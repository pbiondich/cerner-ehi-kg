## Columns

| # | Column | Type | Null? | Flags | Definition |
|--:|--------|------|:-----:|-------|------------|
| 1 | `AP_PREFIX_PROC_GRP_R_ID` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | Unique generated number that identifies a single row on the AP_PREFIX_PROC_GRP_R table. |
| 2 | `PREFIX_ID` | DOUBLE |  | FK→ | This field contains the reference to the prefix to which the processing group is associated. This field contains the foreign key value used to join to the prefix information stored on the AP_PREFIX table. |
| 3 | `PROCESSING_GRP_CD` | DOUBLE |  |  | Code Value of the Processing Group. This is the Group Cd which holds a group of tasks defined in APSDBTools - Processing Group Task Tool. These values are stored in Code set 1310.; |
| 4 | `UPDT_APPLCTX` | DOUBLE |  |  | The application context number from the record info block. The UPDT family of columns are typically used for housekeeping and external system process and should never be depended on for solution specific logic. |
| 5 | `UPDT_CNT` | DOUBLE |  |  | Set to 0 on insert. Incremented by 1 on update. Used to recognize update conflict where data in a row updated by one application is at risk of being lost by a second application attempting to update the row. The UPDT family of columns are typically used for housekeeping and external system process and should never be depended on for solution specific logic. |
| 6 | `UPDT_DT_TM` | DATETIME |  |  | The date and time the row was last inserted or updated. The UPDT family of columns are typically used for housekeeping and external system process and should never be depended on for solution specific logic. |
| 7 | `UPDT_ID` | DOUBLE |  |  | The person_id of the person from the personnel table (prsnl) that caused the last insert or update of the row in the table. The UPDT family of columns are typically used for housekeeping and external system process and should never be depended on for solution specific logic. |
| 8 | `UPDT_TASK` | DOUBLE |  |  | The registered (assigned) task number for the process that inserted or updated the row. The UPDT family of columns are typically used for housekeeping and external system process and should never be depended on for solution specific logic. |
