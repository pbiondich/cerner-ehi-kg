| 4 | `ACTIVE_STATUS_PRSNL_ID` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL | FK→ | The person who caused the active_status_cd to be set or change. |
| 5 | `BEG_EFFECTIVE_DT_TM` | DATETIME | NOT NULL |  | The date and time for which this table row becomes effective. Normally, this will be the date and time the row is added, but could be a past or future date and time. |
