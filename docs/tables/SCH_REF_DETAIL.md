| 3 | `ACTIVE_STATUS_DT_TM` | DATETIME |  |  | The date and time that the active_status_cd was set. |
| 4 | `ACTIVE_STATUS_PRSNL_ID` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | The person who caused the active_status_cd to be set or change. |
| 5 | `BEG_EFFECTIVE_DT_TM` | DATETIME |  |  | The date and time for which this table row becomes effective. Normally, this will be the date and time the row is added, but could be a past or future date and time. |

| 7 | `END_EFFECTIVE_DT_TM` | DATETIME |  |  | The date/time after which the row is no longer valid as active current data. This may be valued with the date that the row became inactive. |
| 8 | `NULL_DT_TM` | DATETIME | NOT NULL |  | contains 31-DEC-2100 00:00:00.00. This field is used to maintain foreign keys to tables that contain a VERSION_DT_TM in the primary key. |
| 9 | `OE_FIELD_DISPLAY_VALUE` | VARCHAR(255) |  |  | An accept format alphanumeric value. |
| 10 | `OE_FIELD_DT_TM_VALUE` | DATETIME |  |  | An accept format date and time value. |
| 11 | `OE_FIELD_ID` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL | FK→ | The unique identifier for the order entry field. |
| 12 | `OE_FIELD_MEANING` | VARCHAR(25) |  |  | Defined the piece of information represented. |
| 13 | `OE_FIELD_MEANING_ID` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL | FK→ | Defines the piece of information represented by the field. |
| 14 | `OE_FIELD_VALUE` | DOUBLE |  |  | An accept format numeric value. |
| 15 | `PARENT_ID` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL |  | The unique identifier of the parent object. |
